## Lab 1 

Problem  LFAT5

### Task:

1. Write C program, which will realise the the matrix/vector
   multiplication G*b with G formed as the full matrix (without
   exploiting the sparsity) in two versions:
   a) fully sequential,
   b) using the broadcasting technique in the OpenMPI
      environment. Take vector b constructed as follows:
      b = [ 1, 2, 1, 2, ... , 1, 2, 1, 2 ]^T

2. Write C program, which will realise the the matrix/vector
   multiplication G*b with G formed expoliting the sparsity in
   two versions:
   a) fully sequential,
   b) using the broadcasting technique in the OpenMPI
      environment. Take vector b constructed as follows:
      b = [ 1, 2, 1, 2, ... , 1, 2, 1, 2 ]^T

3. Compare execution times for all four versions.
